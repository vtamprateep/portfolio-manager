# Portfolio Manager

## Summary
This is a personal project to develop a portfolio management engine, allowing for implementation of new algorithmic trading strategies and portfolio rebalancing features. 

Notable features this project includes are:
- [TD Ameritrade Developers API](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/apis)
- Alex Golec's [`tda-api`](https://github.com/alexgolec/tda-api) wrapping that provides a very useful and clean way to interface with the TD Ameritrade API
- [Backtrader](https://github.com/mementum/backtrader), a Python package that enables users to easily back test their strategy prior to implementing them in production

## Motivation
I had more recently gotten serious about developing a good foundation in programming, system design, and overall just creating a product that wasn't just for looks but could actually provide value to myself. After discovering the TD Ameritrade API, I thought it would be a really cool opportunity to merge the two skills I was really interested in building: Data Science and Software Development

With the rise of roboadvisors and decline in active management, I thought I would personally try my hand at low(er) risk, algorithmic trading. My goals for this project are as follows:

1. Implement a portfolio rebalancing feature
2. Implement a simple algorithmic trading strategy
3. Implement a backtesting pipeline for new strategies
4. Implement a strategy ranking system that will auto-allocate portions of my portfolio to specific strategies
